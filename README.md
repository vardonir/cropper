# Cropper!

Client-side image cropping tool. No servers. No ads. No downloads. Not even cookies. Just you and your images. Yes, even those ones, I'm not judging. Developed in under 3 hours with partial assistance from generative AI tools. [Icons from Tabler.](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons)

Full disclosure: I am using Google Analytics to track page views, but that's it - I just want to know if this tool is being used at all. 

## Known bugs

- Preview image is not updated properly when running clear all
